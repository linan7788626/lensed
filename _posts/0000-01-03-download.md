#### What's that?

There are two ways to get Lensed:

The first is downloading one of our releases from above.
These are regularly updated versions of the code with an associated number that
make it easier to talk about a specific set of implemented features. The
version number is printed at the start or by running `lensed --version`.
Lensed uses [semantic versioning][semver], and increases the individual version
numbers for backward-incompatible major changes, backward-compatible minor
changes, and patches, respectively. Once you have downloaded any given version
of Lensed, you can work with it and make sure others have the exact same one.

The other way of getting Lensed is through the [code repository][code]. This
