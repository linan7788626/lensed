## What is Lensed?

Lensed is a scientific tool to reconstruct gravitational lensing systems from
observations of strong lensing (like the one at the top of this page). Armed
with a FITS file from a telescope, and a configuration file containing a model
for the observation, it allows you to explore the parameter space of the model
in a Bayesian fashion. Lensed runs on GPU and CPU devices for maximal speed and
efficiency in the computations.


## How does it work?

Using your provided model, Lensed will render the expected image of the lensing
event for a large number of parameter settings, thereby exploring the space of
possible realisations of the observation. It compares the expectation to the
observed image by calculating the likelihood that the observation was indeed
produced by the assumed model, thus reconstructing the probability distribution
over the parameter space of the model.
